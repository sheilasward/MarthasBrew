	<h1>Welcome to Martha's Brew!</h1>

	<div id="body">
		<p>We are a drive-thru coffee shop located at 2400 West Friendly Ave, Greensboro, NC.</p>

		<p>Our shop serves a large variety of both hot and cold coffees, and since we are at a strategic location near the downtown area, there is much traffic - especially at morning rush hour.</p>

		<p>To decrease the time spent ordering and paying in our drive-thru, we are excited about offering this on-line ordering system where a customer can order and pre-pay!  We have a special line at the drive-thru for pre-pay customers which moves very quickly.</p>

		<p>If you would like to take advantage of the on-line ordering system, spend a minute or so to register with us, and enjoy zipping through the drive-thru each morning with very little wait time!
